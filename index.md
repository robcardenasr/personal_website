# Welcome to my website! 

Hello! my name is Roberto Cárdenas-Retamal, I am an economist (BA) and I studied natural resources and environmental economics (M.Sc.) at the University of Concepción, Chile.

I am currently a part-time lecturer at the Economics Department of the Universidad Católica de la Santísima Concepción and a research assistant at Interdisciplinary Center for Aquaculture Research (INCAR).

My interests are in economic development (in a broad sense) and sustainability. My expertise has been in socio-economic sustainability of the salmon industry, intrahousehold bargaining and time use, transition of energy consumption towards cleaner sources at the household level. I am also interested in economic history, economic education and economic pluralism.
